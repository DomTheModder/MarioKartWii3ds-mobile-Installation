# MKW3dsLink
A link for MkW3ds as an .cia file, a Mario Kart 7 custom track distribution as an link to be directly installed via FBI.

This is only useful if you don't have an Computer, since you could just copy the files provided on your SD-Card.

You can Install the MkW3ds Installer on the FBI app (assuming that ur 2ds/3ds is homebrewed) by clicking on the .cia file then holding down on the blue text "view raw" and clicking "Copy URL". Now u can either type out the URL one on one or go on a QR-Code creation website and scan it with the FBI app. The extra files for the installer must be installed with the FTPD app on your 2ds/3ds and an app for your phone called FTP manager.

When you open FTPD on your 2ds/3ds you will get an address which you can use to connect to your phone. Then u can transfer the files that i provided in the Releases tab to your Console.

I will say this once again. This method is NOT worth doing if you can use a computer, since a method via PC would be way simpler.

I also do not claim to have made MkW3ds. The original files can be found on: "https://mk3ds.com/index.php?title=Mario_Kart_Wii_3DS"
